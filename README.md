# Create React App With Express Back-end

This Create React App boilerplate is integrated with an express back-end and ready to deploy to Heroku while still taking advantage of Hot-Module-Replacement when run locally.

## Usage

To begin, remove the git remotes after cloning by running `rm -rf .git`.

To start the application, simply run `npm start`.

To deploy to Heroku, simply run the following commands:

`heroku create <name-of-your-app>` 

followed by:

`npm run deploy`

And that's it.
